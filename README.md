# Select Time Zone
I write this a PowerShell UI to deploy to users to allow the user to change the time zone on the device. This was originally intended for a user to select their timezone on first logon. I wanted the this to popup to look and feel like something from Windows Out-of-Box-Experience without having to build a custom OOBE.xml.
